    <h1 class="page-title">The Story</h1><br>
    <h2>How did Moro start?</h2>
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">
      The app started with a friend of mine that played a 'challenge' with his friends to find the ugliest shoes. He found a shoe and sent it to his friends.
      After that, everyone gave their opinion and they chose the winner. It quickly became unclear who would be the winner.
      So I thought it would be a great idea for an app to make this process easier.
    </p>
    <h2>The Name</h2>
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">
      'Moro' means 'fun' in Norwegian. Since I started this app my dream was to start a company in Norway.
      Why Norway? I think it's an amazing country with beautiful nature. Somewhere in the middle of nowhere working together with creative and
      passionate people to create more fun apps/games that you can enjoy with your friends.
    </p>
    <h2>Passion</h2>
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">
      My passion is creating apps. I really like the fact that I can make something and I get the chance to change the lives of potential millions of people.
    </p><br>
    <h1 class="page-title">The Goal</h1><br>
    <h2>Save the planet.</h2>
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">
      Our generation will face some real challenges regarding the climate. Moro wants to help and make that challenge a bit smaller for the next generation.
      Profits of the app will go to charities who clean the oceans and protect/plant trees!
    </p>
    <h2>Enjoy.</h2>
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">
      I'm trying to create games that you, your friends and all other living things in the universe will enjoy.
      I think playing together makes everything much more fun. You cannot only use Moro to boost your creativity, but also connect with people around the world.</p>
    <h2>Creativity.</h2>
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">
      Today, tomorrow and 10 years from now I think creativity is more important than your school degree. With Moro I try to stimulate your creativity.
      Play Moro and be prepared for the future!
    </p>

  <h1 class="page-title">How to play Moro?</h1><br>
  <h2>With Groups</h2><br>
  <h3>The basics</h3>
  <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">
    The owner of the group makes up a challenge with a time limit, let’s take 1 day as an example.
    Everyone in the group can be creative with the challenge in their own way and send in a photo or video of it.
    All players in the group can rate each other's submission from 0-10.
    The person who has the highest average rating at the end of the day may come up with a new challenge.
  </p>
  <h3>Levels</h3>
  <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">
    The owner can upgrade his group with coins, the group then gets access to more time options for challenges and more members.
    In order to upgrade the group, the owner needs to have his user level at the same level as his group's.
    For instance, the owner wants to upgrade his group to level 2, but his user level is still on level 1. He has to upgrade his user level first.
  </p>
  <h3>Different gamemode</h3>
  <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">
    In the app you can encounter different gamemodes in groups.
    'Normal' gamemode means that everyone can send something and judge each other. This gives the best player at the end of the challenge the power to create a new challenge in the group.
    ‘Only Leader’ gamemode has the same principle. The group owner comes up with a challenge. Everyone except the group owner can submit something, everyone can judge each other.
    At the end of the challenge, the person with the highest average rating is the winner. He must not come up with a new challenge, that’s the task of the group owner.
    This is useful/cool for teachers who want to challenge their kids in the classroom or influencers and brands who want to challenge their community, etc.
  </p>

  <h2>With Cups</h2><br>
  <h3>The basics</h3>
  <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">
    A cup is kind of a worldwide group. Someone creates a cup with a challenge that lasts 1 month.
    Everyone can send something and rate each other.
    Challenging the world gives the opportunity to reach everyone, everywhere. Think of the Ice Bucket Challenge.
    Just have a little bit of fun.
  </p>

  <h2>With Friends</h2>
  <p>
    What if you don't want to play with other people and don't want a time limit for challenges? Of course you can also play with 1 friend.
    Find them from all over the world by username or search nearby players!
  </p>
  <h3>The basics</h3>
  <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">
    You or your friend starts the first challenge. You and your friend both submit a photo from video.
    Rate the submissions of each other. If you both like the same thing, someone wins and that person can start the new challenge.
    If you disagreed, a tie will result. If that's the situation, you both have the power to come up with a new challenge!
  </p>

  <h2>The app</h2><br>
  <h3>Users</h3>
  <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">
    When you create an account, you start on level 1. You'll have a limit on active groups, active friendships or groups that you can create.
    If you upgrade your account, you'll get access to more exciting stuff!
  </p>
  <h3>The shop</h3>
  <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">
    In the shop you can buy loads of things. Get unlimited access for your account, a token for your group to get access to unlimited members/time options.
    Or buy 'Random Challenges' packages if you haven't got inspiration for challenges anymore.
    You can also exchange the points you earn from playing this game to coins inside of here.

  <!-- <h2>The Roadtrip</h2>
  <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">
    Moro Entertainment was born in 2020 after I started creating apps out of interest. "How does an app work? How can we create something that's fun and multiple people can play?"
    To get answers on those questions I put in hours, days and weeks figuring out how to build something.
    <br>I knew if I would put enough hours I could learn everything. But learning how to make something is only the start.
    After you learn the first thing you're gonna learn something else. Keep learning, there is never an end.
    That's what makes you stand out from others. Sometimes you'll have struggles, just like I had/have. But the internet is so big. There is always an answer on your question.
    And if you don't get the answer after searching 100 times, don't give up, just search another 100 times.
    You'll always get the answer if you really want it. Some wise words from Moro.<br><br>

    While I was building and learning I started struggling mentally, still. I can't hide it, but I've learned how to deal with it.
    You may not see these things from the outside, but that's why the whole process has been a rollercoaster for me.
    But I wouldn't have wanted to miss this experience. I enjoyed working on it and acquired a lot of knowledge that I will bring with me throughout my life.
