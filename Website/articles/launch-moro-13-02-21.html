    <h1 class="news-title">Launch Moro</h1>
    <p>by <strong>Bram Heetkamp</strong></p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/moro/id1513555095" target="_blank" class="dark underlined">Moro</a> officially launched today! &#x1F382; One of the projects I've been working on for the last 3 years. It feels amazing that everyone can play it right now!
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m very proud of what I’ve accomplished and I’m grateful for my family and all my friends who have always been there for me. It was a hell of a ride.
    </p>
      <a href="/about-moro">
    <blockquote>
        <h2>How did Moro start?</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">
          The app started with a friend of mine that played a 'challenge' with his friends to find the ugliest shoes. He found a shoe and sent it to his friends.
          After that, everyone gave their opinion and they chose the winner. It quickly became unclear who would be the winner.
          So I thought it would be a great idea for an app to make this process easier.
        </p>
        <h2>The Roadtrip</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">
          Moro Entertainment was born in 2020 after I started creating apps out of interest. "How does an app work? How can we create something that's fun and multiple people can play?"
          To get answers on those questions I put in hours, days and weeks figuring out how to build something.
          <br>I knew if I would put enough hours I could learn everything. But learning how to make something is only the start.
          After you learn the first thing you're gonna learn something else. Keep learning, there is never an end.
          That's what makes you stand out from others. Sometimes you'll have struggles, just like I had/have. But the internet is so big. There is always an answer on your question.
          And if you don't get the answer after searching 100 times, don't give up, just search another 100 times.
          You'll always get the answer if you really want it. Some wise words from Moro.<br><br>

          While I was building and learning I started struggling mentally, still. I can't hide it, but I've learned how to deal with it.
          You may not see these things from the outside, but that's why the whole process has been a rollercoaster for me.
          But I wouldn't have wanted to miss this experience. I enjoyed working on it and acquired a lot of knowledge that I will bring with me throughout my life.
        </p>
        <h2>The Name</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">
          'Moro' means 'fun' in Norwegian. Since I started this app my dream was to start a company in Norway.
          Why Norway? I think it's an amazing country with beautiful nature. Somewhere in the middle of nowhere working together with creative and
          passionate people to create more fun apps/games that you can enjoy with your friends.
        </p>
        <h2>Passion</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">
          My passion is creating apps. I really like the fact that I can make something and I get the chance to change the lives of potential millions of people.
        </p>

    <p>
      Along the road I’ve learned some lessons.<br>
      Aim high. Work hard. Dream big. And believe in yourself. If you want to chase your dreams, you need to work for it.
      One little tip from the holy kiwi &#129373;: don't stay up too late if you have to go to school the next day..<br>
      Whatever you do in life, as long as you enjoy what you do, the rest will follow.<br>
      <strong>Enjoy life</strong>, how hard it may be sometimes.
    </p>
    <h2>What does it mean?</h2>
    <p>
      Everyone around the world with an Apple device can now download Moro via the App Store.<br>
      <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/moro/id1513555095" target="_blank" class="dark underlined">Place your beautiful vinger here and download the app!</a><br><br>
      I would appreciate if you'd leave a review behind. If you really don't feel like it, I can offer you a vegetarian turkey &#129411;, but that's it.
